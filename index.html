        <hr />
        
        <p>There are many different chords in music and when playing guitar,
            these chords can be associated with shapes on its fretboard. Most
            commonly, someone new to playing guitar or any instrument, really, 
            will learn the five most popular chords: 
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="center">
            <b>C, A, G, E, and D.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Newer guitar players determine the chords to play by their shape, which are usually shown on 
            guides called <b>chord charts.</b>
            
            The standard tuning for a guitar allows for these five shapes to be played
            anywhere on its fretboard, allowing the musician to play almost any other chord they choose.
            However, where the chord is played matters. 
            
            I won't be explaining the theory in detail, but if
            you can learn more about the guitar's tuning on <a href="https://www.theguitarjournal.com/why-is-the-guitar-tuned-the-way-it-is/#:~:text=So%20why%20do%20we%20continue,visualizing%20and%20playing%20them%20easy."

            If you don't know anything about chord charts or
            guitar, then here's a little guide to help you.

        <h2>Crash Course on Charts</h2>
        <div class="guide">
            <p>
                Below is a chord chart for C. What looks like a grid represents the
                actual fretboard of the guitar, with each line representing a string. Almost every
                chord chart implies that you're playing the instrument right-handed: in other words,
                you're strumming with your right hand.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The X's above instruct that you do <i>not</i> play those strings. This is very important
                    since each string, either pressed down or not, represents a note. Wrong note, wrong sound.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    The O's above show what you play "open," or play a string without pressing on it.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    The numbers on top represent your fingers, where 1 is your index, 2 is your middle and so on.
                    Some chords will need your thumb to play, which is usually shown with either a 5 or a T for thumb.
                </li>

        <h2 id="skipped">Why It Works</h2>

        <p>
            Remember what I said about how each string is a note? For each fret you go down on the guitar,
            you move up half a musical step: that means, if you're pressing the E string on the first fret,
            you're playing an F, and if you're pressing the A string on the fifth, you're playing D, and so on.
            The CAGED System is designed so that you're playing the <b>fundamental notes</b> for each chord
            (called the root, third, and fifth). 
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are some examples of <b>triads,</b> or the three notes that make up a simple major chord.
            The root for each chord is the same note as which chord it is.
            
        </p>

        <table id="triads">
            <tr>
                <th>Chord</th>
                <th>Third</th>
                <th>Fifth</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>C</td>
                <td>E</td>
                <td>G</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>D</td>
                <td>F#</td>
                <td>A</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>E</td>
                <td>G#</td>
                <td>B</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>F</td>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>C</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>G</td>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>D</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>A</td>
                <td>C#</td>
                <td>E</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>B</td>
                <td>D#</td>
                <td>F#</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <p>
            Keep in mind that you should not play the open notes if you're not playing in one of the CAGED chord's
            initial position, as they will be different than the notes heard in the chord. It won't sound right.
